# My First React + Vite + TailwindCSS Project

Welcome! 👋👋

This is my very first project built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
I'm excited to dive in, learn, and create awesome things with these powerful tools. Stay tuned for more projects and improvements as I continue my journey!

## 🚀 How to test this project

- git clone https://github.com/MateiMihaiG/simple-react-password-generator.git
- cd simple-react-password-generator
- npm install
- npm run dev

You need to have **NodeJS** installed on your machine.

## :exclamation: Changelog

- 20.06.2025 - Added instructions on how to clone and test this generator.
- 21.06.2025 - Added tooltips on each option.
- 21.06.2025 - Added show generation date/time for each recent password

## ✅ To Do List

- Dark/light theme
(On hold for now — still looking for a way to implement this using TailwindCSS 4.1, the latest version.)

- Export recent passwords as CSV
(Coming soon...)

- Support custom validation rules (For example: must start with a letter, must contain at least 2 symbols, etc.)
(Coming soon...)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Since this is my first project with these technologies, you might find some mistakes or things that could be improved.  
I'm learning as I go, so feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
